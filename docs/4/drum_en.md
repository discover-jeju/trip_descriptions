The research conducted by American medical doctor Barry Bittman has demonstrated that when a person without any experience of drumming plays for one hour, the number of natural killer cells (a type of cytotoxic lymphocyte critical in killing tumor cells and virus-infected cells) is significantly increased, thereby decreasing stress. 
Aside from a scientific paper, it will be a very special experience to enjoy the moment when you become one with nature by passionately beating out a rhythm.
