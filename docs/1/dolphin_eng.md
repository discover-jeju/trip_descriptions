Without going abroad or sailing in an expensive yacht, 
tourists can enjoy an amazing encounter with a group of wild dolphins on Jeju’s southwest coast, where the probability of sighting dolphins is highest, as discovered by Discover Jeju during its explorations of Jeju.




 
Encounter wild dolphins in the company of Jeju fishermen who know the waters around Jeju better than anyone.

About 120 Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins live in the coastal waters of Jeju Island.

Although dolphins are an amazing sight for most mainland people, the inhabitants of Jeju’s coastal areas are familiar with dolphins, as they often encounter them while swimming or fishing on a boat. 

When haenyeo (female divers) find dolphins while they are diving for seafood, they shout out, “Baeallo, baeallo”, meaning ‘go underneath the boat’ in Jeju dialect, in the hope that the dolphins will pass beneath the boat because their mischievous behavior can be dangerous.

Discover Jeju has opted to use Jeju fishermen’s ships as dolphin exploration vessels, rather than luxurious yachts or cruise ships.

Dolphins have been designated as an endangered species and are subject to protection. However, fishermen are not really pleased to see dolphins when they are fishing because dolphins drive fish away or sometimes caught in the net, causing fishery losses. 

Nevertheless, if dolphins become an additional source of tourism revenue, fishermen might take the lead in protecting dolphins!
Thus, our wild dolphin discovery tour with native Jeju fishermen is not an expensive yacht tour, but a win-win tourism product that is offered to tourists at a reasonable price.
